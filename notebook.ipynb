    "1. **Genre Preference**: Global success requires high performance in NA Action/Shooter markets, but sustainable platform growth in JP relies on RPGs.\n",
    "2. **The Bundle Effect**: Top-selling titles (Wii Sports, Duck Hunt) often benefited from being hardware pack-ins, a strategy that redefined \"success.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Call to Action\n",
    "For developers and investors looking to enter the market:\n",
    "- **Target Cross-Region Genres**: Platforms that support both Action and RPG genres see more consistent long-term viability.\n",
    "- **Leverage First-Party Synergy**: Consider the impact of platform-exclusive features on sales multiples.\n",
